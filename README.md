### Updating the package list

After adding the repo to apt, update the package list with

``` listing
    sudo apt-get update
```

APT will likely complain about a missing key. If it does you can resolve
this by running the following:

``` listing
    sudo apt-get install i2p-keyring && apt-get update
```

Alternately, you may [download the key
here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230910184541/https://geti2p.net/_static/i2p-debian-repo.key.asc)
and then do:

``` listing
    sudo apt-key add i2p-debian-repo.key.asc
```
